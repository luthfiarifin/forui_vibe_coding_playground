### **3\. Functional & Design Requirements**

#### **3.1. General Design Principles**

- **Modern & Clean UI:** The user interface must be aesthetically modern, with a focus on clarity, generous spacing, and intuitive data presentation.
- **Mobile-First Design:** The application prioritizes mobile user experience with touch-optimized interactions and mobile-specific navigation patterns.
- **Dark & Futuristic Theme:** The UI will adopt a dark theme to create a high-tech feel.
  - **Background:** Dark blue-gray (\#0F172A)
  - **Content Containers:** Lighter dark blue-gray (\#1E293B)
  - **Primary Accent:** Light Blue/Cyan (\#38BDF8)
- **Component-Driven:** The UI will be constructed using officially documented components from the ForUI library to ensure visual consistency and adherence to its design system.

#### **3.2. UI Modules**

- **Main Layout:** The application will have a primary layout consisting of a header, main content area, and bottom navigation. A sidebar area should be considered in the structure for future scalability, even if not implemented in V1.
- **Bottom Navigation Module:** This module provides mobile-optimized navigation with five primary sections:
  - **Dashboard:** Current screen (active state)
  - **Analytics:** Future implementation for detailed reports
  - **Alerts:** Future implementation for notification management
  - **Devices:** Future implementation for device control
  - **Settings:** Future implementation for app configuration
  - Navigation items display with icons and labels, using accent color for active states
  - Includes toast feedback for unimplemented sections showing "Coming soon" messages
- **KPI Grid Module:** This module must display at least four key metrics. Each metric should be presented in its own container and include an icon, a title, and a prominent value.
- **Power Trend Chart Module:** This module will be housed in a larger container with a clear title. It must display a line chart with two distinct data series, a visible grid, and labeled axes.
- **Energy Source Breakdown Module:** This module will be in a container with a title. It must display a pie chart showing the percentage breakdown of at least four energy sources.
- **Active Alerts Module:** This module will display a list of important notifications using a component like FAlert, featuring an icon, a title, and a brief description, with colors indicating severity.
- **Device Status List Module:** This module will provide a scannable list of key infrastructure components, each with a name, status, and a corresponding status indicator.
- **System Efficiency Gauge Module:** This will be a visually prominent module with a title like "Grid Efficiency".
  - It will feature a large radial gauge or progress circle (from fl_chart or a custom painter) displaying the current system efficiency as a percentage (e.g., 98.7%).
  - The center of the gauge should display the percentage in large, clear text.

### **4\. Technical & Architectural Requirements**

#### **4.1. Tech Stack**

- **Platform:** Flutter Web
- **Framework:** Flutter (latest stable version)
- **Language:** Dart
- **UI Component Library:** forui (latest version from pub.dev)
- **Charting Library:** fl_chart (latest version from pub.dev)

#### **4.2. Project Structure & Architecture**

- **Modular File Structure:** The UI must be broken down into logical widgets, each in its own file. A recommended structure would be:  
  lib/  
  ├── screens/  
  │ └── dashboard_screen.dart  
  ├── widgets/  
  │ ├── layout/  
  │ │ ├── header.dart  
  │ │ ├── main_content.dart  
  │ │ ├── bottom_navigation.dart // Mobile navigation  
  │ │ └── sidebar.dart // Stubbed for future use  
  │ ├── dashboard/  
  │ │ ├── kpi_grid.dart  
  │ │ ├── power_trend_chart.dart  
  │ │ ├── energy_source_pie_chart.dart  
  │ │ ├── active_alerts.dart  
  │ │ ├── device_status_list.dart  
  │ │ └── system_efficiency_gauge.dart  
  │ └── shared/  
  │ ├── stat_card.dart  
  │ └── device_list_item.dart  
  └── main.dart

- **Separation of Concerns:** Logic should be kept separate from the UI code where possible. For V1, this means data definitions should be separate from the widget build methods.
- **Mobile-First Responsiveness:** The layout must be built with mobile devices as the primary target, using tools like MediaQuery for screen size detection. Define breakpoints and leave TODO comments where responsive adaptations will be added for tablet and desktop.

#### **4.3. Navigation Architecture**

- **Bottom Navigation Implementation:** Use a StatefulWidget for the dashboard screen to manage navigation state
- **Toast Feedback System:** Implement toast notifications for unimplemented navigation sections
- **Future Navigation Preparation:** Structure the navigation to easily accommodate routing to actual screens in future versions

#### **4.4. Code Quality & Documentation**

- **Component Usage:** All UI elements must be built using components from the forui package where applicable.
- **Comments:** The code must be well-commented to explain the project structure, the purpose of complex widgets, and any TODO items.
- **Navigation Documentation:** Clear documentation of the navigation structure and planned future implementations.

### **5\. Out of Scope for V1**

- Fully implemented responsive layouts for tablet and desktop.
- Real-time data integration from APIs.
- User authentication, profiles, or settings.
- Navigation to any other screens beyond the dashboard.
- Actual routing to Analytics, Alerts, Devices, and Settings sections (toast feedback only).

### **6\. V1 Implementation Notes**

#### **6.1. Navigation Behavior**

- **Dashboard Tab:** Always active, no action when tapped
- **Other Tabs:** Show toast notification with "Coming soon - Feature under development" message
- **Visual Feedback:** Active tab highlighted with accent color, inactive tabs in gray
- **Mobile Optimization:** Touch targets optimized for mobile interaction (minimum 44px)

#### **6.2. Future Migration Path**

- **V1.1:** Implement tablet/desktop layouts with sidebar navigation
- **V1.2:** Add actual routing and screen implementations
- **V1.3:** Implement full functionality for all navigation sections

This mobile-first approach with bottom navigation provides a solid foundation for responsive design implementation in future versions while maintaining excellent mobile user experience in V1.

## **Product Requirements Document: Smart City Energy Tracker - Responsive Layout Enhancement**

Version: 1.1
Date: 20 Juli 2025  
Previous Version: 1.0 (Base Dashboard Implementation)

### **1\. Introduction & Vision**

#### **1.1. Objective**

To enhance the existing Smart City Energy Tracker dashboard with comprehensive responsive design capabilities, transforming it from a mobile-first prototype into a fully adaptive multi-device application. This iteration focuses on optimizing the user experience across tablet and desktop platforms while maintaining the established mobile foundation.

#### **1.2. Vision**

The Smart City Energy Tracker will evolve into a truly responsive web application that seamlessly adapts to any screen size. Grid operators and urban planners will experience optimized layouts whether they're monitoring the system on mobile devices in the field, tablets in meeting rooms, or desktop workstations in control centers. The responsive design will maximize information density and usability across all device categories.

#### **1.3. Target Audience**

- **Primary:** Grid operators using various device types (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Secondary:** Urban planners requiring multi-screen dashboard access
- **Tertiary:** City officials and stakeholders viewing reports on different devices

### **2\. Core Features & User Stories**

#### **2.1. Feature Overview**

The responsive enhancement will implement three distinct layout modes:

- **Mobile Layout (< 768px):** Current V1 implementation with minor optimizations
- **Tablet Layout (768px - 1024px):** Two-column grid system with enhanced navigation
- **Desktop Layout (> 1024px):** Three-column grid with sidebar navigation and advanced layouts

#### **2.2. User Stories**

- **As a Grid Operator on a tablet, I want to** see charts side-by-side so that I can compare power trends and energy sources simultaneously.
- **As a Control Room Supervisor on desktop, I want to** access a persistent sidebar navigation so that I can quickly switch between different dashboard views.
- **As a Field Technician on mobile, I want to** maintain the current optimized mobile experience so that I can efficiently access critical information on-the-go.
- **As an Urban Planner on any device, I want to** have consistent data access regardless of screen size so that I can make informed decisions from any location.

### **3\. Functional & Design Requirements**

#### **3.1. Responsive Breakpoints (ForUI Standard)**

Following ForUI's predefined breakpoint system based on Tailwind CSS:

- **Mobile:** `< md (768px)` (Current V1 implementation)
  - Single-column layout
  - Stacked components
  - Touch-optimized interactions
- **Tablet:** `md (768px) - lg (1024px)`
  - Two-column grid system
  - Horizontal component arrangements
  - Enhanced touch targets
- **Desktop:** `≥ lg (1024px)`
  - Three-column layout with sidebar
  - Multi-column component grids
  - Mouse/keyboard optimized interactions

**ForUI Breakpoint Reference:**

- `sm`: 640px - Small devices
- `md`: 768px - Medium devices (tablets)
- `lg`: 1024px - Large devices (desktops)
- `xl`: 1280px - Extra large screens
- `xl2`: 1536px - Ultra-wide screens

#### **3.2. Layout Adaptations by Breakpoint**

**Mobile (Current - Minor Enhancements)**

- Maintain existing single-column flow
- Optimize touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Improve spacing for better readability

**Tablet Responsive Layout**

- **Header:** Expand to include quick action buttons
- **KPI Grid:** 4-column horizontal layout
- **Charts Section:** Side-by-side Power Trends and Energy Source charts
- **Status Section:** Alerts and Device Status in two-column layout
- **System Efficiency:** Maintain prominent central placement
- **Quick Actions:** Horizontal button row instead of 2x2 grid

**Desktop Responsive Layout**

- **Sidebar:** Persistent navigation panel (200px width)
  - Dashboard navigation menu
  - User profile section
  - Quick settings toggle
  - Collapsible functionality
- **Main Content:** Three-column grid system
  - Left: KPI Grid + System Efficiency
  - Center: Charts (Power Trends, Energy Sources)
  - Right: Alerts + Device Status + Quick Actions
- **Header:** Enhanced with search, notifications, and user controls

#### **3.3. Component-Specific Responsive Behavior**

**KPI Grid**

- Mobile: 2x2 grid (current)
- Tablet: 1x4 horizontal row
- Desktop: 2x2 or 1x4 based on sidebar state

**Charts**

#### **4.2. Technical Specifications**

**Responsive Framework (ForUI Integration)**

```dart
// Using ForUI's built-in breakpoint system
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final breakpoints = context.theme.breakpoints; // FBreakpoints
  final width = MediaQuery.sizeOf(context).width;

  return switch (width) {
    _ when width < breakpoints.md => MobileLayout(),
    _ when width < breakpoints.lg => TabletLayout(),
    _ => DesktopLayout(),
  };
}
```

**Layout Grid System (ForUI Compatible)**

- Leverage ForUI's breakpoint system for consistent responsive behavior
- CSS Grid-inspired approach using Flutter Row/Column widgets
- Responsive spacing and padding utilities aligned with ForUI theme
- Integration with `FThemeData.breakpoints` for seamless theming

**Component Architecture (ForUI Integration)**

- Use ForUI breakpoint patterns directly in components

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final breakpoints = context.theme.breakpoints;
    final width = MediaQuery.sizeOf(context).width;
    
    return switch (width) {
      _ when width < breakpoints.md => _buildMobileGrid(),
      _ when width < breakpoints.lg => _buildTabletGrid(),
      _ => _buildDesktopGrid(),
    };
  }
}
```

#### **6.2. Layout Management**

```dart
// Main responsive layout controller using ForUI breakpoints
class ResponsiveMainContent extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LayoutBuilder(
      builder: (context, constraints) {
        final breakpoints = context.theme.breakpoints;
        final width = constraints.maxWidth;

        return switch (width) {
          _ when width < breakpoints.md => MobileLayout(),
          _ when width < breakpoints.lg => TabletLayout(),
          _ => DesktopLayout(),
        };
      },
    );

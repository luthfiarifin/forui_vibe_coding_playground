## **Product Requirements Document: Smart City Energy Tracker**

Version: 1.0
Date: 20 Juli 2025  

### **1\. Introduction & Vision**

#### **1.1. Objective**

To build a modern, data-centric dashboard as a web application using Flutter and the ForUI component library. This project will serve as a primary educational tool, demonstrating best practices for creating a scalable, modular, and responsive-ready application.

#### **1.2. Vision**

The "Smart City Energy Tracker" will be a visually stunning, single-page web application that provides a clear, at-a-glance overview of a smart city's energy grid. It will translate complex data points into intuitive UI components, showcasing the power of a well-structured Flutter application. For V1, the application will function as a high-fidelity prototype using static data, perfect for a live coding environment.

#### **1.3. Target Audience**

- **Primary:** Attendees of a Flutter workshop with beginner to intermediate skills.
- **Secondary:** Urban planners, city grid operators, and technology enthusiasts interested in data visualization and modern UI/UX design.

### **2\. Core Features & User Stories**

#### **2.1. Feature Overview**

The application will consist of a single, scrollable dashboard screen containing seven primary information modules:

- **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Grid:** A section displaying top-level metrics.
- **Power Trend Chart:** A time-series visualization for energy generation vs. consumption.
- **Energy Source Breakdown:** A chart illustrating the proportional contribution of different energy sources.
- **Active Alerts:** A module to display critical system warnings and notifications.
- **Device Status List:** A list showing the operational status of key smart devices.
- **System Efficiency Gauge:** A prominent visual gauge showing the real-time operational efficiency of the entire grid.
- **Quick Actions:** A panel with interactive buttons for common operator actions.

#### **2.2. User Stories**

- **As a Workshop Attendee, I want to** build an app with a clean, modular structure so I can understand how to organize a scalable Flutter project.
- **As a Grid Operator, I want to** see critical alerts and device statuses immediately so I can prioritize maintenance and response efforts.
- **As a Grid Operator, I want to** have access to common controls directly from the dashboard so I can respond to situations quickly.
- **As an Urban Planner, I want to** analyze energy trends and source breakdowns so that I can make informed decisions for future city planning.

### **3\. Functional & Design Requirements**

#### **3.1. General Design Principles**

- **Modern & Clean UI:** The user interface must be aesthetically modern, with a focus on clarity, generous spacing, and intuitive data presentation.
- **Dark & Futuristic Theme:** The UI will adopt a dark theme to create a high-tech feel.
  - **Background:** Dark blue-gray (\#0F172A)
  - **Content Containers:** Lighter dark blue-gray (\#1E293B)
  - **Primary Accent:** Light Blue/Cyan (\#38BDF8)
- **Component-Driven:** The UI will be constructed using officially documented components from the ForUI library to ensure visual consistency and adherence to its design system.

#### **3.2. UI Modules**

- **Main Layout:** The application will have a primary layout consisting of a header and a main content area. A sidebar area should be considered in the structure for future scalability, even if not implemented in V1.
- **KPI Grid Module:** This module must display at least four key metrics. Each metric should be presented in its own container and include an icon, a title, and a prominent value.
- **Power Trend Chart Module:** This module will be housed in a larger container with a clear title. It must display a line chart with two distinct data series, a visible grid, and labeled axes.
- **Energy Source Breakdown Module:** This module will be in a container with a title. It must display a pie chart showing the percentage breakdown of at least four energy sources.
- **Active Alerts Module:** This module will display a list of important notifications using a component like FAlert, featuring an icon, a title, and a brief description, with colors indicating severity.
- **Device Status List Module:** This module will provide a scannable list of key infrastructure components, each with a name, status, and a corresponding status indicator.
- **System Efficiency Gauge Module:** This will be a visually prominent module with a title like "Grid Efficiency".
  - It will feature a large radial gauge or progress circle (from fl_chart or a custom painter) displaying the current system efficiency as a percentage (e.g., 98.7%).
  - The center of the gauge should display the percentage in large, clear text.
- **Quick Actions Module:** This module provides a set of interactive controls for the user.
  - It should have a title like "Quick Actions".
  - It will contain a row or small grid of FButton components.
  - Each button will have an icon and a label for a specific action (e.g., "Reroute Power", "System Diagnostics", "Dispatch Team"). For V1, these buttons will be for display only and will not have functionality.

### **4\. Technical & Architectural Requirements**

#### **4.1. Tech Stack**

- **Platform:** Flutter Web
- **Framework:** Flutter (latest stable version)
- **Language:** Dart
- **UI Component Library:** forui (latest version from pub.dev)
- **Charting Library:** fl_chart (latest version from pub.dev)

#### **4.2. Project Structure & Architecture**

- **Modular File Structure:** The UI must be broken down into logical widgets, each in its own file. A recommended structure would be:  
  lib/  
  ├── screens/  
  │ └── dashboard_screen.dart  
  ├── widgets/  
  │ ├── layout/  
  │ │ ├── header.dart  
  │ │ └── main_content.dart  
  │ │ └── sidebar.dart // Stubbed for future use  
  │ ├── dashboard/  
  │ │ ├── kpi_grid.dart  
  │ │ ├── power_trend_chart.dart  
  │ │ ├── energy_source_pie_chart.dart  
  │ │ ├── active_alerts.dart  
  │ │ ├── device_status_list.dart  
  │ │ ├── system_efficiency_gauge.dart  
  │ │ └── quick_actions.dart  
  │ └── shared/  
  │ ├── stat_card.dart  
  │ └── device_list_item.dart  
  └── main.dart

- **Separation of Concerns:** Logic should be kept separate from the UI code where possible. For V1, this means data definitions should be separate from the widget build methods.
- **Responsiveness Preparation:** The layout must be built with responsiveness in mind using tools like LayoutBuilder and MediaQuery. Define breakpoints and leave TODO comments where responsive adaptations will be added.

#### **4.3. Code Quality & Documentation**

- **Component Usage:** All UI elements must be built using components from the forui package where applicable.
- **Comments:** The code must be well-commented to explain the project structure, the purpose of complex widgets, and any TODO items.

### **5\. Out of Scope for V1**

- Fully implemented responsive layouts for tablet and desktop.
- Real-time data integration from APIs.
- User authentication, profiles, or settings.
- Navigation to any other screens.
- Functionality for the "Quick Actions" buttons.
